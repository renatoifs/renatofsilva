<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested the development of a clean, professional, bilingual (Portuguese + English) academic website for a Faculty member at the University of Porto. The initial requirements included a multi-page site with sections for Home, About, Research, Teaching, Projects, Publications, and Contact. The content was to be extracted from a provided CV and other links. The design was specified as minimalist, with a dark blue and neutral color palette. The user also required the ability to automatically update publications from Autênticos.

Over the course of the interaction, the requirements were significantly simplified. The user, wanting a zero-cost and zero-maintenance solution, abandoned the multi-page dynamic application in favor of a very simple, single-page static digital business card site.

The final requirements are:
- A single-page static website.
- Content to include: Name, photo, title, a brief intro, research areas, links to academic profiles (ORCID, Scopus, etc.), institutional affiliations logos, and contact information.
- Remove the separate pages for Publications, Projects, and Teaching, as this information is available via the external profile links.
- The site must be bilingual (PT/EN).
- The final output should be deployable for free on GitHub Pages.
- The user has created a new GitHub account  for this purpose, and the target URL is .

**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates primarily in **Portuguese**. The next agent MUST respond in Portuguese.

**what currently exists?**
The agent initially built a full-stack React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) application with multiple pages, a bilingual system, and a simple CMS for content management. However, due to the user's request for a free, no-maintenance solution, this entire application is now considered **obsolete**.

The agent has pivoted and created the necessary files for a new, simple, single-page static website. These files (, , , ) are currently located in the  directory.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Creating the asset files for the new, simplified, single-page static website. The agent generated the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a README with deployment instructions. The immediate next step was to copy the necessary image assets (profile picture, logos) and package everything into a ZIP file for the user.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual user verification. The agent should provide the user with a ZIP file of the static site and clear instructions on how to upload it to their  repository. The agent cannot test this flow directly.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Finalize and Deliver the Static Website (P0)**
  - **Description:** The user wants the simple, single-page static website to be finalized and made available for them to deploy on their GitHub account (). The agent has created the code but needs to package it with all assets and provide clear deployment instructions.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** The user must perform manual verification of the frontend after they deploy it to GitHub Pages.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Package and Guide Deployment of the Static Site (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** The agent has created the static files in . It must now:
    1.  Copy the necessary image assets (profile photo, institution logos) into the  directory.
    2.  Create a single ZIP archive containing all the contents of .
    3.  Provide clear, step-by-step instructions in Portuguese for the user to upload these files to a new GitHub repository named  to publish the website.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The user will have a complete, zero-maintenance personal website hosted for free, fulfilling their final request.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** User verification on the frontend.
  - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- None. The user's explicit goal is a zero maintenance site. All future updates are out of scope for the agent.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Initial Full-Stack App (Now Obsolete):**
  - Developed a complete multi-page bilingual (PT/EN) website using React and FastAPI.
  - Implemented sections for Home, About, Research, Teaching, Projects, and Publications.
  - Created a simple CMS with authentication () for editing site content.
  - Integrated user feedback on design, content, and layout.
- **Consultation & Pivot:**
  - Explained hosting options, costs, and the difference between dynamic and static sites.
  - Guided the user through the implications of a free vs. paid solution.
  - Successfully pivoted from a complex dynamic application to a simple static site based on user's final decision.
- **Static Site Creation (In Progress):**
  - Generated the , , and  for the new one-page static site.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- Not applicable. All user-reported issues on the initial application were either fixed or made irrelevant by the pivot to a static site.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**
The **current and final target architecture** is a simple static website:

The original full-stack application architecture in  is **deprecated**.

**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Final Implementation:** Static Site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), to be hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Deprecated Implementation:** Full-Stack Application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB).

**key DB schema**
- None. The final version is a static site and does not use a database.

**changes in tech stack**
- A major pivot was made from a **Full-Stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB)** application to a **Static (HTML, CSS, JS)** website to meet the user's requirement for a zero-cost solution.

**All files of reference**
- : The HTML structure for the new one-page site.
- : The styling for the new site.
- : Handles the language switching functionality.
- : Contains instructions for the user on how to deploy the site to their GitHub account.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The entire content of the  directory (the initial full-stack application) is now obsolete and can be ignored. No refactoring is needed, as the focus is solely on delivering the new static site from .

**key api endpoints**
- None. The final static site has no backend API.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **PIVOT:** The user has completely changed the project scope. **IGNORE the complex React/FastAPI application in .** The sole objective now is to deliver the simple, single-page static website whose files are being prepared in .
- **ZERO COST:** The user's primary constraint is that the solution must be 100% free. This is why GitHub Pages was chosen.
- **ZERO MAINTENANCE:** The user wants a set it and forget it website. All features requiring updates (like Publications, Projects) have been removed.
- **GITHUB ACCOUNT:** The user has created a new GitHub account with the username . The agent's final instructions should guide the user to create a repository named  and upload the files there.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- : The relevant instruction file for the current task.
- (Obsolete guides: , , )
